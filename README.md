# Sales-Price-Forecasting-via-Tree-Models

 In this project, I will be performing an exhaustive analysis in order to gain insights and engineer features with an interactive exploratory analysis and finally will use XGB to predict. Furthermore, I investigated and evaluated tree models (XgBoost, GBDT, Random Forest) on Rossman store dataset. Used Person Correlation to conduct feature selection,analyzed the correlation between independent variable and dependent variable using sklearn, matplotlib, pandas . Implemented and developed three classical boosting and bagging tree model algorithms, such as XgBoost, GBDT and Random Forest. Conducted grid search to optimize the hyper-parameters, such as the numer of trees and the depth of the tree. And extracted the time stamp as new features which helped reduce 6% rMSE. Observed that XgBoost achieved 17% rMSE reduction compared with other tree models
